# Lost Bottles Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive Lost Bottles workflow that uses status flags and smart views instead of separate tables, with a user submission system and admin approval dashboard.

## Database Changes

### New Columns Added

**core_brands:**
- `is_orphaned` (boolean, default false) - True if brand has no supplier relationships
- `orphaned_at` (timestamptz, nullable) - Timestamp when brand lost its last supplier
- `orphaned_reason` (text, nullable) - Why orphaned (e.g., 'supplier_removed', 'never_linked')

**core_suppliers:**
- `is_orphaned` (boolean, default false) - True if supplier has no distributor relationships
- `orphaned_at` (timestamptz, nullable) - Timestamp when supplier lost its last distributor
- `orphaned_reason` (text, nullable) - Why orphaned (e.g., 'distributor_removed', 'never_linked')

### Database Triggers (Automatic Orphan Detection)

**Brand Orphan Detection:**
- `trigger_clear_brand_orphan` - Fires on INSERT to `brand_supplier` ‚Üí clears orphan status
- `trigger_check_brand_orphan` - Fires on DELETE from `brand_supplier` ‚Üí marks as orphaned if no other suppliers remain

**Supplier Orphan Detection:**
- `trigger_clear_supplier_orphan` - Fires on INSERT to `distributor_supplier_state` ‚Üí clears orphan status
- `trigger_check_supplier_orphan` - Fires on DELETE from `distributor_supplier_state` ‚Üí marks as orphaned if no other distributors remain

### Database Views

- `view_orphaned_brands` - Filtered view of orphaned brands (WHERE is_orphaned = true)
- `view_orphaned_suppliers` - Filtered view of orphaned suppliers (WHERE is_orphaned = true)

### Submission Schema Updates

- Added `'Orphan_Correction'` to `brand_submission_type` enum
- Added `'supplier_distributor'` to `brand_category` check constraint
- Supports orphan correction submissions in `brand_submissions` table

## User-Facing Features

### Lost Bottles in iOS App
The Lost Bottles feature is implemented in the BottleTrace iOS app (not in the admin portal). Users can:
- View all orphaned brands and suppliers
- Select a supplier for an orphaned brand
- Select a distributor + state for an orphaned supplier
- Add optional notes/context
- Submit suggestions for admin approval via the API

Submissions are stored in `brand_submissions` with:
- `submission_type: 'Orphan_Correction'`
- `status: 'pending'`
- `brand_category: 'brand_supplier'` or `'supplier_distributor'`
- Complete payload with orphan details and suggested relationships

## Admin Features

### Submissions Dashboard (`/admin/submissions`)
Admin dashboard for reviewing all submissions:
- Tabs for different statuses (Pending, Under Review, Approved, Rejected)
- Shows submission type (Addition, Change, Orphan Correction)
- Displays submission details based on category
- Approve/Reject actions with inline controls
- Rejection reason tracking

### Admin Orphans Audit Page (`/audit/orphans`)
Updated admin tool for direct orphan management:
- Fetches ALL orphaned records using pagination (not limited to 1,000)
- Simplified queries using `is_orphaned` flag (no complex filtering)
- Direct linking capability (admin only)
- Notice directing users to submit via iOS app
- Automatic orphan status clearing via triggers

## API Endpoints

### POST `/api/submissions`
Create new submission (orphan correction, addition, or change)
- Validates payload structure
- Inserts into `brand_submissions` table
- Returns submission ID

### POST `/api/submissions/[id]/approve`
Approve a submission:
- For brand_supplier orphan corrections ‚Üí creates `brand_supplier` relationship
- For supplier_distributor orphan corrections ‚Üí creates `distributor_supplier_state` relationship
- Triggers automatically clear orphan status
- Updates submission status to 'approved'

### POST `/api/submissions/[id]/reject`
Reject a submission:
- Updates status to 'rejected'
- Stores rejection reason
- No database changes made

### GET `/api/submissions`
List submissions with optional filtering:
- Query params: status, submission_type, brand_category
- Returns all matching submissions

## Navigation Updates

Updated navigation in sidebar:

**Admin:**
- üìù Submissions Dashboard - Review submissions from iOS app
- üçæ Orphaned Records - Direct admin management tool

## Current Statistics

- **Orphaned Brands:** 1,680
- **Orphaned Suppliers:** 132
- All existing orphans marked with `orphaned_at` = `created_at` and `orphaned_reason` = 'never_linked'

## Trigger Testing

‚úÖ **Verified working:**
- INSERT trigger clears orphan status when relationship added
- DELETE trigger marks as orphaned when last relationship removed
- Timestamps and reasons are automatically set

## Benefits

1. **Simpler Architecture** - No separate orphan tables to maintain
2. **Automatic** - Triggers keep status synchronized with relationships
3. **Better Performance** - Direct column lookups vs. complex joins
4. **Audit Trail** - Timestamps track when records became orphaned
5. **User Engagement** - Users can help improve data quality
6. **Admin Control** - All submissions reviewed before going live
7. **Unified Workflow** - Same approval system for additions, changes, and orphan corrections

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add email notifications when submissions are approved/rejected
2. Add orphan badges to main Brands/Suppliers pages
3. Add analytics dashboard showing orphan correction trends
4. Implement batch approval for trusted users
5. Add submission edit capability before approval
